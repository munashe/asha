				It takes a while, but the am slowly writing on the blog less about coding Masaisai (the last two posts were about that) and focusing on my life. This blog will now be about me as a person.
				</br>
				So lets talk about CGI.</br></br>
				I have a CGI image i really like, i made it using blender software. I like this image because its refreshing, quenching and dynamic. Below is the render: A GLASS OF WATER

				I made the above in Geneva, Switzerland when i went through a phase which centered around creating CGI. The tutorial to make the above was over an hour long, and to make the render on my slow laptop, took over a day.</br>

				Masaisai is progressing well, with the website getting more content each passing day. On the coding side, the site is now in BETA. This means that the website is no almost ready to cormfortable accept visitors, with on or two bugs here and there.
<br>
<br>
The move to Masaisai version 4, has begun. A good question you might have might be: why upload Masaisai version 4 before 6? Well the answer to that is  the fourth the version had a unique aspect to it, which when developed further outmatched the planned Masaisai version 6.

				I resumed work on the website, adding new pages and learning through a hands on approach how to make use of the MVC design paradigm. It has been fun informative and life changing. The progress which i made on the site in one hour would have taken me days using the old cut and paste method of making a website.<br><br>
				The only regret i have is that i did not learn of MVC sooner since it makes  life a whole lot easier.
